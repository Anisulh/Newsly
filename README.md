Welcome to the repository for Newsly, a news recommendation engine inspired by TikTok's "For You" page. Newsly leverages a backend written in Go, utilizing the Fiber framework for its lightweight and efficient server capabilities, Templ for templating, and HTMX for dynamic content updates.

## Project Overview

Newsly aims to deliver a seamless and highly personalized news reading experience. By integrating advanced NLP techniques using a custom-tuned BERT model, the system categorizes and tags incoming news articles which are then recommended based on user interactions such as likes, dislikes, and saves. Hereâ€™s how it works:

- **News Fetching**: A cron job regularly fetches news articles from various sources via the News API.
- **Processing via Kafka**: These articles are sent to an NLP service through Kafka, where they are analyzed and categorized.
- **User Interaction Tracking**: User preferences are dynamically updated based on their interactions with the articles.
- **Continuous Learning**: The recommendation algorithm adjusts to user preferences, providing increasingly accurate article suggestions.
- **Infinite Scrolling**: New articles load as the user scrolls, ensuring an endless stream of personalized content.

## Technologies

- **Backend**: Written in Go with the Fiber framework for optimal performance.
- **Frontend**: TailwindCSS for styling and HTMX for partial HTML updates without reloading.
- **NLP**: Utilizes a fine-tuned BERT model for natural language processing to categorize and tag news articles.
- **Messaging**: Apache Kafka handles message passing between the news fetching cron job and the NLP service.
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication secures user accounts and preferences.
